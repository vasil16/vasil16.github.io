      <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey! I’m Abdul Rahiman Vasil Abrar—a game developer, software engineer, and lifelong learner from Kasaragod,
        Kerala.

        I specialize in building games and systems that feel alive—whether that’s a VR app where you can interact with
        objects using real physics, or a mobile game that hooks players in with just the right mechanics and feedback.

        My journey started with Java, diving deep into logic building, OOP, and real-time system optimization. That’s
        where I learned to think in code: breaking down problems, optimizing execution, and writing clean, modular
        solutions. But the real magic happened when I found Unity. It felt like putting code into motion—and I was
        hooked.

        Since then, I’ve worked on everything from hyper-casual mobile games to full-blown VR experiences. I’ve led
        gameplay mechanics, built AI decision systems, optimized rendering, and crafted immersive UI/UX. I even enjoy
        digging into the nitty-gritty—debugging, refactoring, and boosting performance until it just feels right.

        I’m currently open to new opportunities—either in game development, real-time systems, or Java-based backend
        work. If it’s challenging, creative, and performance-driven, I’m in.

          <h3>🎮 Game Developer → Senior Game Developer</h3>
          <h4>Dumadu Studios, Bangalore</h4>
          <h5>May 2023 – Present</h5>
          <p>
            When I joined Dumadu Studios, I hit the ground running—building casual and hyper-casual games that had to be
            fast, fun, and addictive. I quickly learned how crucial performance optimization is for mobile platforms: I
            trimmed load times, improved asset management, and rewrote messy logic into cleaner, modular systems.

            Over time, I got the chance to dig deeper into gameplay mechanics and experiment with AI logic. I built
            responsive HUDs, tweaked game feel until everything “clicked,” and even helped increase user retention
            through small but meaningful changes based on real player feedback.

            That hands-on experience laid the foundation for something bigger: stepping into VR.

            As I moved into a Senior Game Developer role, I started leading development on immersive VR
            applications—complete with physics-based object interactions, intuitive hand tracking, and environments that
            felt alive. The challenge? Getting all of this to run smoothly while still looking sharp. That meant
            optimizing rendering pipelines, refining asset workflows, and rethinking how users interact in 3D space.

            One of the highlights was designing AI systems that could predict trajectories and make smart decisions,
            adding a whole new layer of realism to gameplay. I also had the chance to mentor junior devs, which helped
            me grow as a communicator and team player.

            And while my core was game dev, I wore the software engineer hat often—debugging performance issues,
            designing reusable systems, and implementing real-time logic for interactive experiences. Working in Agile
            teams taught me how to ship features quickly without sacrificing quality.

            Looking back, my time at Dumadu Studios has been a crash course in everything I love: creative
            problem-solving, performance tuning, and bringing interactive worlds to life—whether on flat screens or in
            VR headsets.

          <h3>📊 Client Associate</h3>
          <h4>ReSource Pro, Bangalore</h4>
          <h5>Sep 2022 – May 2023</h5>
          <p>
            Before I dove fully into development, I spent time working in the insurance operations world—and while it
            might sound far from game dev, this job taught me some of the most valuable soft skills I carry today.

            At ReSource Pro, I worked directly on client systems, performing data-heavy tasks that demanded speed and
            precision. I had to follow strict guidelines, document every process clearly, and ensure high accuracy
            across every workflow. It was less about writing code and more about writing clean procedures—and that focus
            on clarity and consistency is something I still carry into every script and system I build.

            One of the biggest takeaways was communication. I interacted with clients regularly, sending detailed
            updates, learning new systems, and constantly adapting to shifting workflows. It gave me a strong foundation
            in structured thinking, problem-solving under constraints, and spotting the tiny errors that can derail
            bigger processes.

            Looking back, this role helped sharpen my discipline, process awareness, and ability to stay focused on
            quality—all of which translated directly into how I now approach debugging, code documentation, and system
            design.
